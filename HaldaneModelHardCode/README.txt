This software is intended to be used for scientific purpuse with the authorization and cooperation of the developers, partiucuylarly the main one, DR. Alexis Chacon and my PhD Student Mr. Dasol Kim. We hope you respect this policy and kindlely ask as for further support or at least cite formally it. 

The code need to use MPI compilers and run over single and multi-core platforms to compute the high-order harmonic generation from a 2D band model with hexagonal strucrure, particularluy the we implemented the semiconductor bloch equations (SBEs) to futher study the topological phases of matter and transitions via the paradigmatic haldane model.


1) To run the code you need to modify the parameters of the input file called, input.in.

2) compile it by the make file:
   $ make

3) run via terminal the script namealy: benchmark_sample.sh and pass a variable name type string
   $ ./benchmark_sample.sh NameOfYourPreference

4) you should be responsable of the MPI versions and platform in which you wish to run the code, in any case also we will assis youy bu under the condition of collaboration and co-author of at least the first 2 papers you publish with this code. 

5) To visualize the results, you shoud access to NameOfYourPreference and run the python scrip AnalysisReader_PyDir.py


Sinceresly your,
Prof. Dr. Alexis Chacon Sep27, 2020
